# Case-Coverter

Made for converting **UPPERCASE** characters to **lowercase** characters, and the other way around! The meaning of this project was to try out the basics of **[EEL](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel)**.  This has some unnessecary code as you could create it in just python or javascript but the whole meaning was to try out these two togheter.
