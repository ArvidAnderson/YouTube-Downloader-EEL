# YouTube Downloader EEL

This YouTube downloader was created using **Python**, **Javascript**, **HTML** and **css**. The goal of this project was to learn som more **[EEL](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel#:~:text=Eel%20is%20a%20little%20Python,from%20Javascript,%20and%20vice%20versa.)**.  I had to import tkinter as there was no other option to open a file dialog for selecting directories in EEL or Javascript natively. Using tkinter turned out to be working great in the end.

Right now the only thing the downloader can do is download the video in the best resolution progressive stream as well as the downloading the audio separately. Left to do is the option to select which kind of stream (resolution, fps, etc) to download
